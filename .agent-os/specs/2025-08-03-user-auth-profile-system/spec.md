> Spec: User Authentication and Profile System
> Created: 2025-08-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive user authentication and profile system that enables players to create accounts, track progression, and personalize their arcade gaming experience. This foundational system will support all future social, competitive, and progression features in Arcade World.

## User Stories

### Account Creation and Authentication

As a new player, I want to create an account using my email or Google account, so that I can save my progress and compete with friends.

Players will be able to register using Firebase Authentication with email/password or Google OAuth. The system will support account linking to allow guest players to convert their temporary progress to permanent accounts. All authentication flows will be mobile-responsive and include proper error handling and validation.

### Profile Management and Customization

As a registered player, I want to create and customize my profile with a display name and track my gaming statistics, so that I can build my arcade identity and see my progression over time.

Players can set up their profile with display name, view their gaming statistics including total points earned, games played, current level, and XP progress. The profile will serve as the central hub for viewing achievements and progression across all arcade games.

### Player Progression Tracking

As an active player, I want to earn experience points and level up through gameplay, so that I can unlock new content and feel a sense of advancement in the arcade platform.

The system will automatically track player activities, award XP for various achievements (completing games, reaching high scores, daily play), and manage level progression with unlocks tied to player advancement.
