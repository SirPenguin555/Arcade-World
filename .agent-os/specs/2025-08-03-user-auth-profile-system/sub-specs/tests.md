### Feature Tests (End-to-End)

**User Registration and Onboarding**
- New user visits site and creates account with email
- User completes profile setup with display name
- User sees welcome tour and initial game recommendations
- Profile appears correctly in navigation and displays stats

**Authentication Workflows**
- User logs in with email and password successfully  
- User logs in with Google OAuth successfully
- User switches between guest and registered account
- User experiences authentication errors gracefully
- User session persists across browser restarts

**Profile and Progression Management**

- User edits display name and preferences successfully
- User earns XP from playing games and sees level progression
- User unlocks new content based on level advancement
- User views detailed game statistics and achievement progress

**Account Linking Scenarios**
- Guest user plays games and accumulates progress
- Guest user decides to create permanent account
- Account linking preserves all guest progress and statistics
- Linked account maintains game history and achievements
- User can access their data from any device after linking

### Mocking Requirements

**Firebase Authentication Mocking**
