## 2025-08-03: Migration to Supabase

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team
**Related Spec:** Authentication System Implementation

### Decision

Migrate from Firebase to Supabase for authentication, database, and backend services.

### Context

During Phase 0 implementation, the team decided to switch from Firebase to Supabase to leverage PostgreSQL's relational database capabilities, which are better suited for gaming data with complex relationships (users, scores, leaderboards, transactions).

### Rationale

- **Better SQL Support:** PostgreSQL offers more complex queries needed for leaderboards and game statistics
- **Real-time Subscriptions:** Supabase provides real-time functionality similar to Firebase
- **Row Level Security:** Built-in security policies for protecting user data
- **Cost Effectiveness:** More predictable pricing model for gaming workloads

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- More flexible database schema for complex gaming data
- Better performance for analytical queries (leaderboards, statistics)
- Integrated authentication with database security policies

**Negative:**
- Required migration effort during initial development
- Team learning curve for PostgreSQL vs NoSQL

## 2025-08-03: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Arcade World will be a web-based gaming platform that recreates the authentic arcade experience through a collection of classic and modern arcade games, combined with a comprehensive virtual economy system (points, tickets, prizes) and progressive unlocking of themed arcade environments.

### Context

The casual gaming market lacks a unified platform that captures the nostalgic arcade experience with modern web technologies. Current arcade games are fragmented across platforms without cohesive progression systems or the social competitive elements that made physical arcades special. There's an opportunity to recreate the arcade reward loop (play → earn → prizes → enhanced gameplay) in a digital format that appeals to both nostalgia seekers and modern casual gamers.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single-Game Focus (like a standalone Pac-Man game)**
   - Pros: Simpler development, focused experience, easier to polish
   - Cons: Limited long-term engagement, no progression system, lacks platform potential

2. **Social Casino-Style Platform**
   - Pros: Proven monetization model, social features, progression systems
   - Cons: Gambling associations, potential regulatory issues, not family-friendly

3. **Game Development Platform (like Roblox for arcade games)**
   - Pros: User-generated content, infinite scalability, community-driven
   - Cons: Complex moderation, quality control challenges, requires content creation tools

### Rationale

The curated arcade platform approach provides the best balance of manageable scope, clear value proposition, and scalability. Key factors in this decision:

- **Manageable Scope:** Unlike user-generated platforms, we control quality and can plan development systematically
- **Clear Value Proposition:** Recreates beloved arcade experience with modern convenience and social features
- **Scalable Architecture:** Platform can expand with new games, arcade themes, and social features over time
- **Monetization Alignment:** Virtual economy mirrors real arcade economics without gambling concerns
- **Technical Feasibility:** Web technologies can deliver arcade-quality gaming with broad device compatibility

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear product vision that resonates with target demographic
- Scalable platform architecture supporting long-term growth  
- Family-friendly monetization model aligned with arcade tradition
- Strong differentiation from existing casual gaming platforms
- Technical stack well-suited for real-time gaming and social features

**Negative:**
- Requires developing multiple games rather than perfecting one
- Complex virtual economy system needs careful balance and testing
- Higher initial development investment compared to single-game approach
- Success depends on quality execution across multiple game experiences
- Social and multiplayer features add significant technical complexity
